# Fire-Detection-System

The objective of our project was to design and implement a fire detection system that addresses the limitations of traditional smoke sensors by incorporating machine learning. The following design specifications were identified at the outset of the project: 
  Develop a system that can accurately detect the presence of fire. 
  Estimate the size or extent of the fire to provide insights into its intensity.  
  Utilize image processing techniques to analyze real-time images captured by a webcam. 
  Implement machine learning algorithms to classify fire and non-fire scenarios. 
  Integrate hardware components such as a Raspberry Pi, LCD screen, relay, and PCB for enhanced functionality. 
  Control a water pump using a relay for immediate fire suppression actions.
